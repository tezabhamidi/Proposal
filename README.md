# IIT Hyderabad PhD Proposal template for Quarto users

This is a Quarto (https://quarto.org) compatible template forked from Utpal Bora (). 

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system based on Markdown and Pandoc with which one can:

 - Author using Jupyter notebooks or with plain text markdown in your favorite editor.
 - Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
 - Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
 - Share knowledge and insights organization-wide by publishing to Posit Connect, Confluence, or other publishing systems.
 - Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

Hope those in IITH using Quarto, find it useful. :)

Note: The thesis class has very minor tweaks which were required to make the bibtex citations work.
